# LMAX Exchange Implementation

A complete implementation of the [LMAX Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html) demonstrating the power of single-threaded processing and elimination of database transactions in high-performance trading systems.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This implementation closely follows Martin Fowler's description of the LMAX Architecture with three core components:

```

│  Input Disruptor│───▶│ Business Logic       │───▶│ Output Disruptor │

│ • High Throughput│    │ • Event Sourcing    │    │ • Notifications  │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘
```

## 🎯 Key LMAX Principles Demonstrated

### 1. **Single-Threaded Business Logic**

- All trading operations run on a single thread
- Eliminates complex locking and synchronization
- Provides predictable, low-latency processing
- Achieves 6M+ transactions per second on commodity hardware

### 2. **No Database Transactions**

- All state kept in memory
- Event Sourcing provides durability
- Complete state reconstruction from event stream
- No slow I/O operations in critical path

### 3. **Complex Transaction Processing**

As described in the LMAX article, each order involves:

- ✅ Checking if target market is open
- ✅ Validating order for that market
- ✅ Choosing the right matching policy
- ✅ Sequencing orders for best price matching
- ✅ Creating and publicizing trades
- ✅ Updating prices based on new trades

### 4. **Mechanical Sympathy**

- Cache-friendly data structures
- Lock-free ring buffers (LMAX Disruptor)
- Minimal object allocation
- CPU-efficient algorithms

## 🚀 Running the System

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Maven 3.6+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- wrk (for performance testing)

### Quick Start - Docker Production Stack

```bash
# 🐳 Start the complete stack (PostgreSQL + LMAX Exchange)
make stack-up

# 🩺 Verify system health
make health-check

# 🧪 Run performance tests
make test-wrk-light    # Light load test (4t/50c/30s)
make test-wrk-medium   # Medium load test (8t/100c/60s)
make test-wrk-heavy    # Heavy load test (12t/200c/120s)

# 📊 Check system metrics
make metrics

# 🛑 Stop the stack
make stack-down
```

### Local Development

```bash
# Build the project
mvn clean compile

# Run the exchange demo (runs demo and exits)
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.lmax.exchange.ExchangeMain" -Dexec.args="demo"

# Run in server mode (starts HTTP API)
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.lmax.exchange.ExchangeMain"

# Run tests
mvn test
```

### API Endpoints

Once running, the LMAX Exchange provides these HTTP endpoints:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health

# Submit an order
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user":"trader1","symbol":"BTCUSD","type":"LIMIT","side":"BUY","price":"45000.00","qty":10}'

# Get system metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/metrics

# Get active orders for a symbol
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/orders/BTCUSD

# Get trades for a symbol
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/trades/BTCUSD
```

## 🔍 Code Structure

### Core Components

#### Business Logic Processor (`BusinessLogicProcessor.java`)

The heart of the system - single-threaded processor handling all trading logic:

```java
public synchronized ProcessingResult processOrder(String userId, String symbol,
                                                 Order.OrderType type, Order.OrderSide side,
                                                 BigDecimal price, long quantity,
                                                 Order.TimeInForce timeInForce) {
    // 1. Check market status
    // 2. Validate order
    // 3. Process matching
    // 4. Update state
    // 5. Journal events
}
```

#### Input Disruptor (`InputDisruptor.java`)

High-performance, lock-free order ingestion:

```java
public void submitOrder(...) {
    long sequence = ringBuffer.next();
    try {
        OrderEvent event = ringBuffer.get(sequence);
        event.setOrderData(...);
    } finally {
        ringBuffer.publish(sequence);
    }
}
```

#### Output Disruptor (`OutputDisruptor.java`)

Parallel processing of output events:

- Market data publishing
- Audit trail logging
- Client notifications

### Domain Models

#### Order (`Order.java`)

Immutable order representation with:

- Order types: MARKET, LIMIT, STOP, STOP_LIMIT
- Sides: BUY, SELL
- Time in force: GTC, IOC, FOK
- Status tracking: PENDING, FILLED, CANCELLED

#### Trade (`Trade.java`)

Immutable trade execution record

#### Market (`Market.java`)

Market state with real-time price updates

### Event Sourcing (`events/`)

Complete event-driven architecture:

- `OrderPlacedEvent`
- `TradeExecutedEvent`
- `MarketDataUpdatedEvent`

## 🧪 Testing

The test suite demonstrates key LMAX principles:

### Single-Threaded Complex Transactions

```java
@Test
void testSingleThreadedComplexTransactionProcessing() {
    // Tests the 6-step process described in LMAX article
    // 1. Market validation
    // 2. Order validation
    // 3. Matching policy selection
    // 4. Price-time priority sequencing
    // 5. Trade creation and publication
    // 6. Market data updates
}
```

### Event Sourcing (No Database)

```java
@Test
void testEventSourcingNoDatabaseTransactions() {
    // Demonstrates complete state reconstruction from events
    // No database transactions required
}
```

### High-Frequency Trading Performance

```java
@Test
void testHighThroughputSingleThreadedProcessing() {
    // Processes 1000+ orders concurrently
    // Verifies >100K orders/second throughput
}
```

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

This implementation demonstrates:

1. **Why Single-Threading Wins**: Eliminates the complexity of concurrent programming while achieving higher performance through mechanical sympathy

2. **Event Sourcing Benefits**: Complete auditability and state reconstruction without database transactions

3. **LMAX Disruptor Power**: Lock-free, high-performance inter-thread communication

4. **Domain-Driven Design**: Clean separation between domain logic and infrastructure concerns

5. **Financial Systems Architecture**: How exchanges process millions of transactions with microsecond latencies
